## Morning Brew Twitter API Analysis

### Understanding
##### engagement patterns

### Solving
##### a personal hypothesis

### Finding
##### "significant" tweets


## Goal 
The goal of the following was to successfully access the Twitter API and uncover insights about the performance/engagement between Morning Brew  and its community. 

## Solution 
I ingested, cleaned, and transformed a Morning Brew tweet dataset to uncover the performance between tweets of different media types.  

## Results 
Using an exploratory type of analysis and implementing a machine learning model, I discovered that 31.9% of tweets from Morning Brew between late September and late January were organic tweets (no media attached) and 68% of the tweets had either a gif, photo, or url attached. 

Additionally, I determined that there exists a linear relationship between favorites and retweets by engineering a linear regression model.

Lastly, I posted a tweet to my Twitter via my IDE [Tweet](https://twitter.com/drewbyts/status/1482758292157779969?s=20&t=3fnIllEEuEk2Pc3xlMyLyg) ðŸ˜ƒ
