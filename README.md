# Morning Brew Twitter API Analysis 👨‍💻

# Goal 
The goal was to access the Twitter API and uncover quick insights about the engagement between Morning Brew and its community. 

# Method
I ingested, cleaned, and transformed a Morning Brew tweet dataset to uncover the performance between tweets of different media types. I utilized janitor, tidyverse, and ggplot to analyze and visualize findings. 

# Results 
I discovered that 31.9% of tweets from Morning Brew between late September and late January (time period of analysis) were organic tweets (no media attached) and 68% of the tweets had either a gif, photo, or url attached.

Additionally, I determined that there exists a linear relationship between favorites and retweets by engineering a linear regression model.

Lastly, I posted a tweet to my Twitter via my IDE [Tweet](https://twitter.com/drewbyts/status/1482758292157779969?s=20&t=3fnIllEEuEk2Pc3xlMyLyg) 😃
