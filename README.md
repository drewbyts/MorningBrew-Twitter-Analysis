# MorningBrew Twitter Analysis

The following project is a simple twitter analysis that was used for a MorningBrew Job Application. 

The objective was to identify the type of tweets that generated the most interaction between the newsletter company and its consumers.

Additionally, it was determined that there exists a linear relationship between favorites and retweets through a simple linear regression.

Lastly, I learned how to access the Twitter API and was able to tweet via R Studio.
